                How the application works
            </h1>
            <p>
                The mongodb and node images are built with docker. Tailwindcss and daisyUI are node plugins that are installed during the buildprocess. 
                These were used for nice css styles. Containerizing the application allows it to be built from almost any machine with very little setup and configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                The node app serves index.html, style.css, and script.js with express when the user visits the root of the node app. All of the CRUD functionality is available from here.
                There is also a browse button to view all products in the database as well as the about button which links to a page briefly explaining how the website works (hadn't been been implemented when video was recorded).
                The app is accesible by the host machines ip on port 8080 from anywhere on the local network assuming the networks port rules allow this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ajax is used with js to dynamically change the contents of the page according to what the user chooses to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                All database operations are handles by node on the backend.
            </p>
